# permaculture-map-berlin

## Objective 

Contemporary urban societies are faced with numerous environmental, sociological, economic, and other challenges. For many, permaculture, as a unique and innovative form of gardening, commonly practices in urban environment, provides the best response to many of these issues. Our project aims to showcase numerous successful examples from Berlin using an interactive map and to educate users about the advantages of regenerative urban food production. Our project serves as a powerful tool to connect and educate individuals passionate about sustainable urban living, ultimately contributing to making Berlin a greener and more environmentally conscious city.

## Target Groups

Our target audience consists of nature lovers, individuals passionate about a healthy lifestyle and diet, advocates and activists of environmental movements, but also all the citizens of the capital city Berlin who are looking for green oases amidst the concrete jungle due to various needs. Berlin is a world metropolis that draws global attention, and its residents aspire to live in accordance with the most contemporary ecological principles.

## Benefits 

Our product will offer two vital functions:
1.	An easy and straightforward search of all permaculture projects in Berlin, achieved through an interactive map, which will be the main feature of our website. For this, we will utilize the Story Map technology of ArcGIS. Story Maps allow the combination of cartographic, textual, and audio-visual material, which will be used to educate our website users about the main features of the permaculture projects included in the map's content.

2.	The website will also contain a unique form page that will allow users to enter information about new permaculture projects in Berlin. This type of crowd sourcing will continuously support the extension of our existing database and updating of the map. A lasting benefit of this part of the site is the strong incentive it provides for networking activities among members of the permaculture community in Berlin.
